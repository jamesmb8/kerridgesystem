# Our Kerridge Project

This project allows the user to upload a csv full of packages and then our program will show the best ways to load the lorries with the packages

## The CSV File
You need to have a CSV file that contains the packages you would like to load. The title for these fields must be:
- Count_ID,
- Height,
- Length,
- Surface-Area,
- Type,
- Volume,
- Weight,
- Radius,
- Width.
## Using the results
The system will process your CSV file and use the ID to show you exactly where to place each package inside the lorry.
You can view 5 layers of the lorry and see where each package is located.
You can press the drop down button to view the next lorry if multiple are needed.
You can download a PDF file pressing the download button that will contain the lorry visualization and all loaded packages. This document will assist in physically loading the lorry.
