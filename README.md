# Our Kerridge Project


This project allows the user to upload a csv full of packages and then our program will show the best ways to load the lorries with the packages.
## To download the app
### MacOS
Go to Actions > V 1.1.5 (Build macOS App), the artifact will be shown as macos-kerridgesystem. Download that and the application will be in your downloads called kerridgesystem

### Windows
Go to Actions > V 1.1.5 (Build Windows App), the artifat will be shown as windows-kerridgesystem. Download that and load the .exe. Then you will be promopted to trust and export all the files. Save these files in your library and then you can run the .exe again to run the application 

## The CSV File
You need to have a CSV file that contains the packages you would like to load. The title for these fields must be:
- Count_ID,
- Height,
- Length,
- Surface-Area,
- Type,
- Volume,
- Weight,
- Radius,
- Width.
## Using the results
The system will process your CSV file and use the ID to show you exactly where to place each package inside the lorry.
You can view 5 layers of the lorry and see where each package is located.
You can press the drop down button to view the next lorry if multiple are needed.
You can download a PDF file pressing the download button that will contain the lorry visualization and all loaded packages. This document will assist in physically loading the lorry. The PDF will be downloaded to your default browser.
